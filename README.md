## Disclaimer

All talks are welcome, but we are _not_ here to promote "how we X helped
the company Y to become the biggest in Z". We are here to have some good
conversations about existing technologies, with an emphasis on those that free
our minds.

When proposing a talk, please let us know if you can afford the price of your
trip. This is not mandatory, nor is it a no-go for a talk, but due to the
format of the conference, we might end up not being able to refund your trip.

What we are NOT looking for is company sponsored trips, unless they expect
nothing in return (not even being mentioned on stage), besides getting to
send you to an interesting place with interesting people.

You will most likely be hosted by some Parisians, they usually don't bite, but
drink (and share) lots of wine, cheese. There will be no room service.

SquatConf is an experience, it is up to you to try it.
