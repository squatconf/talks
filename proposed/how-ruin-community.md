# How to ruin a community in 3 easy steps

Caleb James DeLisle

This is less a presentation than a wild tale of trying to keep the Hyperboria network a cool and
friendly place for all kinds of people, especially women and minorities who don't have so many cool
places to go on the internet. I failed hard. I tried to keep an open atmosphere for free exploration
of ideas but ended up with a community infested with nazis and misogynists. Along the way I learned
that tolerance is not necessarily a good thing, that no amount of rules can beat actually knowing
the people you hang with online and that what I call "Anonymous Internet People" have proven to be
the source of almost all community problems.

Still I have not given up. I and a number of others have taken up the task of trying to understand
the forces which lead communities into the gutter and design infrastructure to subtly push people
toward being excellent to each other.
